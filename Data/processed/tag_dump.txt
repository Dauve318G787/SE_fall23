Trial them and decide for your needs

Already did, they are close.. that’s why i need second opinion i few days back i liked petrucci, today i like rabea… and no, i am not on period

I think you'll be fine with either one. If you need the synths obviously go Rabea. I use that one more than Petrucci

Unless you specifically want the synth in Rabea, I’d say get Petrucci. I like Rabea but find I have to work a lot harder to get sounds I like from it. Specifically with the high gain amp, which tends to be really noisy and bassy to the point of being muddy. I don’t think Petrucci is the best sounding plugin but it’s very flexible and sounds pretty good out of the box.
My other suggestion is you’re not looking for bone-crushing low tuned high gain tones would be Plini X. It has a huge amount of flexibility and all of the modern features (transpose, doubler, metronome) since the X update.

I agree - OP also mentioned being into Van Halen and the chorus FX in Petrucci do great for that.

Same for me, I cannot get good sound with Rabea. As you said need to spend too much time to get it. For me Plini or Nolly are better

Both are good just get one and make some music
It’s easy to spend more time worrying about shit like this instead of actually making stuff

Rabea is pretty much the only NDSP plugin that I actively dislike, although the synth is fun.

I would go Petrucci
