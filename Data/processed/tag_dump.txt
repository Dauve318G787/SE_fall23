Thatâ€™s one of my favourite things about a Rabea is the fuzz pedal. Your tone sounds awesome btw, cool playing too. I take it from the name of the tune that youâ€™re using the freeze function on the reverb pedal too? Itâ€™s such a great tool to improvise over ðŸ¤˜

Yeah, i LOVE the Freeze function. You can do so much with it. Ive programmed midi changes so i can shift chords after its frozen, makes it even more fun.

Full session. Crunch channel with no ODÂ´s, until fuzz kicks in after 2 minutes.

Itâ€™s my favorite part of that suite. And it is 2 pedals in one ICYMI!
