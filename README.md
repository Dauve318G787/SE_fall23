This program takes a user given reddit URL to scan, sends the content to a file for OpenAI API to process

# Installation

You can clone this repository and run the yaml file for setup 

```
git clone <HTTPS/SSH/CLI>
python -m venv <env_name>  # Create a new venv
source <env_name>/bin/activate  # Activate the venv on Unix-like systems (use `activate.bat` on Windows)
pip install -r environment.yml  # Install packages from the YAML file
```

# Usage

python main.py https://old.<reddit URL>	# Omit "www" and replace with "old"
```

# Project 3

I did create a branch when I did this part, when I merged it with my main branch I deleted the project3 branch. So you will not see it here.
