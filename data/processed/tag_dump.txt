Could I request an Archetype Petrucci presets thread?

Almost a year and there still isnâ€™t one lmao

I just posted about 18 presets to the Tim Henson forum. (Link above) ENJOY!

Anyone got any good pop punk presets?

I'm looking for some myself! If anybody has anything, please share!

I made one on the Cory Wong for TSSF rhythm stuff, that I think sounds quite good

Iâ€™ll take it!!!

So I just realized I have no idea how to send it lol

There is a way to post your xml file

No love for Soldano? It seems like the only neural DSP without a preset thread.

Man, came here for this. I'm quite a bit disappointed that there's so few presets on that thread.

What type of music do you write?

Iâ€™ve got two main projects, one is metal and the other mostly acoustic

I love the Soldano plugin. I think that tonally it sits nicely between the Gojira and Cory Wong (for me anyway). I just bought the Petrucci plugin and have yet to give it a try.

I just started the trial of Petrucci today. Happy sonic exploration.

I just want to say THANK you for making an active preset thread this is dope! I'll be sharing some stuff soon.

Hello,
I've just noticed this thread and I'd like to mention ToneBin web site (recently created), where you can easily share your presets with others. If you like the idea, there is more info in this thread here on NDSP reddit.
Thanks.

Anybody ever try recreating Ratatat tones with Neural DSP?

Wildcat is the shit!

For sure. Have you ever tried to get that tone with NDSP?

I haven't. I write weirdo rock / metal music but appreciate their form of mind bending musical magic.what type of music do you create? Share a link. I will show support ðŸ¤˜

I just made a post on this subreddit with links to all the free impulse responses & presets I have acquired over the last 18-ish months since getting into interface/DAW/plugins.  Just wanted to post the preset links in here as well since it is the preset thread.  I would wager a guess that every single preset linked in this thread is also in the pack, plus others I found.  The second link goes to a ZIP folder that contains presets for other ampsims - none of those will work in the Neural Plugins.  Just thought I'd offer those up as well.

Hey, any chance you could make a new link for the Neural DSP presets? Thx

The link doesn't work....?
That's weird.  I don't think I moved anything around on that Google Drive account.  I just deleted something the other day (yesterday I think), but that was unrelated.  
But I absolutely can post a new link.  Let me look into this.
EDIT: try now.  They come up for me on a different Google Drive account so I think they're good.  Let me know.

How about a ToneKing thread?

Really interested to see some of the presets shared. Iâ€™m new to this and havenâ€™t a clue how to produce a clean sound so I can play Opeth

Thatâ€™s also my biggest issue. I have no idea how to properly dial in a tone.

Rabea Massad and Ola Englund have tutorials on dialling in tones.
Mine is an old fashioned method, but with a new amp, I set all dials at 12 O'clock and then go one by one to shape the tone.
Some boomier amps need the bass toned down and mids boosted, some 80's thrash tones have more scooped mids.
I use the treble for more clarity and sharper attack, but I also track 'warmer' guitars to thicken the guitar tone along with the bass.

Is there rabea preset group/thread?

I'll be the first! Some pretty good Gojira ones here.

I saw a really dope Panama preset for Nolly in that unity forum.

Anyone have a good Demiurge preset for the Nameless?

There's a clockwork patch in the thread, I'm sure you can tweak it to get demiurge. A lot of meshuggah's sound comes from the bass tone tho

Hi, I'm looking for a preset to get close to the belief and slow dancing in a burning room by Mayer, I have the Corey Wong and Henson Plugins, anyone can help me ?

if anyone has john frusciante priest for cory wong i will love you forever

Desperately looking for guttural clank presets for darkglass and/or parallax. Also looking for contortionist and tesseract tones, I have most of the NDSP plugs.

Anyone know how I can get the â€¦And Justice for All clean tone with Archetype Nolly/Gojira

Noob to Neural DSPs here:
Where do you actually save the Presets to?
EDIT:
Found it.

Where at?

on Windows: C:\ProgramData\Neural DSP\(insert name of plugin here)\
then copy into the User folder or create a new folder

Does anyone know where to save it on Mac?

Thank you, I ended up finding it a week ago in the Neural DSP unity forum.

FYI, you can also just drag and drop the preset file onto the plug-in.

Just happened to create this fun fuzz tone in Gojira, here's a link to it on the official forum: https://unity.neuraldsp.com/t/archetype-gojira-preset-thread/3545/22

Anyone have a nice rockabilly tone for Cory Wong please?

Gojira presets (hopefully you can access these)

Where are these from?  Or are they yours?  Will give these a try, thanks.

These are ones that I made. They probably aren't super great because I was using very colored speakers when I made them.

where do i put them though

Hey bro, I believe I have the location on Windows written down on a Post-It note near my office/studio computer.  I gotta leave to go train shortly, but I'll look for it later today & try to post the Windows location address.  Just posting so that I, hopefully, remember to do so.  
But you can always load up the plug-in & then near the preset drop down list, there is a magnifying glass icon.  If you click on that, it'll bring up a Windows Explorer window & you can navigate to the location you saved the preset XML file in which is likely your Downloads folder if you downloaded it off the internet.  Once you select the XML file, it'll load into the plug-in & then it'll be added to your preset list as well as being saved in the correct location.
I'll still check for the Post-It note.  You can copy your XML files from this folder to a different location to back up them.  You can also create folders within this Windows directory to allow you to kind of sort/organize your preset list.  I have a folder in there called "Final Rhythm Presets" or something similar for example.
